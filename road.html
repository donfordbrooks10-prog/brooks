    <h1>Road Trips & Travel</h1>
    <p>I love going on road trips with family and friends, especially to destinations like Goa and Coorg. The scenic drives, relaxed conversations, beaches, and hills offer the perfect way to unwind and recharge. These trips are not just vacations—they are experiences that strengthen bonds and broaden perspectives.</p>

    <p>I deeply value quality time with my family. Whether it’s gardening together or engaging in learning activities with my child, these moments allow me to connect, slow down, and create meaningful memories.</p>
